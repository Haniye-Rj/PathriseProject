# PathriseProject
Pathrise is a career accelerator for individuals seeking jobs in the tech industry. The company operates on an income share agreement (ISA) model, meaning applicants receive job support and mentorship for free and pay a percentage of their first-year salary once they secure a job. This model ties Pathrise’s profitability directly to their applicants' success in landing jobs. The time it takes applicants to find a job (job search duration) affects Pathrise’s cash flow, resource allocation, and mentor scheduling. Predicting this duration based on applicant metrics can improve operational efficiency and revenue forecasting. Predict the duration of job search for each applicant.
